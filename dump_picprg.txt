dump_picprg

Dumps all the individual PIC configuration information available to the
PICPRG library to the file PICPRG.ENV in the current directory.  The
format of PICPRG.ENV files is described in the PICPRG_ENV documentation
file.

All the entries are sorted by ascending PIC name, and are are written in a
consistent format.  This program can therefore be used to make a "cleaned
up" version of the PICPRG.ENV file after manual changes.

Duplicate entries with the same information are silently ignored.

Duplicate entries with differing information is a hard error.
